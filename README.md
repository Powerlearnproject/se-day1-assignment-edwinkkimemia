Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the act of designing, coding, programming and maintaing software systems and also testing them.
it drives innovation and helps in bulding and maintaing mobile and web apps, hense the user goals are solved via technology

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1968- NATO conference- birth of software engineering
2. introduction to structured programming - improving readerbility and easing maintenance
3. Agile manifesto- focus shifted to rigid, documentation- inteactive , collaborative and user focused


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.\
1 Requirement annalysis- finding whtas is need to achive the best outcome of he software being  developed
2.design- creating the user interface,components,and system achitecture
3.coding- writing down the actual code
4. testing-veryifying that the software works as intended
5. deployment-relasing it to the users
6.maintenance- upating and fxing bugs


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase (e.g., design, coding) completes before the next begins.
  - Pros: Clear structure, easy to manage for fixed requirements.
  - Cons: Inflexible to changes, late testing can reveal major issues.
- Agile: An iterative approach with short cycles (sprints) that emphasize adaptability and collaboration.
  - Pros: Flexible, delivers working software quickly, incorporates feedback early.
  - Cons: Requires strong communication, less predictable timelines.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-writes tests and maintains code
quality assurance engineer- test sotware to ensure it meets quality standards
project manager-oversee project timelines, resources and team cordination

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a unified platform for writing code and  aslo includes debugging tools eg VS code
VCS eg GIT track code changes and enables collaboration, rollback of mistakes, in team projects


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. tight deadline - prioritize tasks
2.bugs- write good code and do periodic testing
3. miscommunication  within team- use collaboration tools

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., functions) to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
2. Integration Testing: Verifies that combined components function together as expected.
3. System Testing: Evaluates the entire system against requirements, checking end-to-end functionality.
4. Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.
   - Importance: These tests collectively catch errors at different levels, ensuring a robust, user-readyÂ product.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear specific instruction to guide Ai models into generating useful responses. its important because wrong or poor wording in prompts will lead to irrelevant answers


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt-tell me about programming
improved prompt- explain the basics of python programming, for beginners focusing on variables, loops andd functions

the improve dprompt narrows down to a specific part in python programning and concise need an answer that beiginners in programming can understand
